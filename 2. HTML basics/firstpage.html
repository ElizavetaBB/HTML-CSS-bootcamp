        <h3>How to use Chat GPT affectively?</h3>
        <p>Instead of prohibiting Chat GPT, we should educate students on how to use it properly and effectively. 
            For majority of students, writing assignments are daunting and they would do anything to avoid them. 
            It is a teachersâ€™ responsibility to build up a strong writing foundation and encourage students to share their unique ideas. 
            We should provide students with a safe space that will inspire them to write creatively. 
            For example, replacing tedious opinion essays with thesis-seeking exploratory projects that 
            spark students curiosity and challenge them in a new way.</p>
        <h3>English as a second language</h3>
        <p>Students who learn English as a second language are often limited in what and how they write. 
            This leads them to use Chat GPT for each assignment and suppresses their creativity and critical thinking.</p>
        <h3>Benefits for practice grammar</h3>
        <p>As for grammar, Chat GPT is a great source to learn topics and get additional practice. 
            Thought process behind the project or essay is more important than a few mistakes that a student made. 
            While teachers should provide a concrete writing and grammar foundation, students should be able to check 
            their papers through technology like Chat GPT.</p>
